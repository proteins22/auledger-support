# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** Feb 24, 2026

Thank you for using **AuLedger** (“the App”). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle any personal information we may access or store in connection with your use of the App.

## 1. Data We Do Not Collect
- We do **not** collect, transmit, or store your personal information on external servers.
- We do **not** use analytics tools, advertising networks, or other third-party data-collection services.
- We do **not** share any user data with third parties.

## 2. Sign in with Apple
- The App offers the option to **Sign in with Apple** for authentication.
- We request basic profile information (name, email) solely for the purpose of allowing you to log in.
- **We do not store** this data on external servers; it remains on your device.
- If you choose to sign in, Apple may process your data according to Apple’s own privacy policy. We encourage you to review Apple’s policy for details on how they handle your information.

## 3. Local Data Storage
- The App stores any user-generated content or gold portfolio information **locally** on your device (e.g., via UserDefaults).
- No user data is uploaded to a server. This means only you have access to the data stored on your device.
- If you delete the App, all locally stored data is removed from your device.

## 4. Children’s Privacy
- We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 (or the equivalent minimum age in your jurisdiction).
- Because we do not collect or store data externally, we have no means to identify users’ ages or store such information.

## 5. Your Choices
- **Sign in with Apple** is optional. If you prefer not to sign in, you can continue to use the App’s basic functionality without providing any personal data.
- You can delete the App at any time to remove all locally stored data.
- If you choose to sign out or remove the App, no personal information is retained on our servers, as we do not store any data externally.

## 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy
- We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons.
- If we make material changes, we will notify you by updating the “Effective Date” above. Your continued use of the App after these changes become effective means you acknowledge the revised Policy.

## 7. Contact Us
If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or your personal data, please contact us at [contact@auledgerapp.com](mailto:contact@auledgerapp.com).
