# AuLedger Support & FAQs

## üìå About the App
**AuLedger** helps you manage your gold collection with **real-time prices**, **portfolio tracking**, and **investment insights**.

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### **Q: How do I add new gold items to my portfolio?**
A: In the app, go to **"Add to Collection"** and enter the details of your gold item, including weight, karat, and purchase price.

### **Q: How does the app fetch live gold prices?**
A: We use real-time market data from **MetalPriceAPI**, ensuring accurate and up-to-date gold price tracking.

### **Q: Does AuLedger store my photos? What happens if I delete them from my iPhone?**
A: Yes, AuLedger creates and stores **local copies** of the photos you select for your collection. This means:
- Your collection remains intact **even if you delete the original photos** from your iPhone‚Äôs library.
- However, these copies **occupy storage** on your device.
- If you need to free up space, you can manually **delete photos from within the app**, but doing so will **permanently remove** them from your collection.

### **Q: Can I sync my data across devices?**
A: **No.** All data is stored **locally** on your device. There is **no cloud sync** feature available.

### **Q: What happens if I delete the app?**
A: **All your saved data will be permanently deleted.** Since we do not store any data on servers, there is no way to recover lost data after the app is removed.

### **Q: How do I remove ads in the app?**
A: You can subscribe to **Premium**, which removes ads and unlocks additional features like **historical price charts**.

### **Q: I purchased the app before March 31, 2025. Do I need to subscribe?**
A: No. If you purchased **AuLedger** before this date, you are automatically granted **lifetime premium access** without needing a subscription.
