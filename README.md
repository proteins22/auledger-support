## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions
**Q: How do I add new gold items to my portfolio?**  
A: In the app, go to "Add to Collection" and enter the details of your gold item.

**Q: How does the app fetch live gold prices?**  
A: We use real-time market data from trusted sources.

**Q: Does AuLedger store my photos? What happens if I delete them from my iPhone?**

- However, these copies will occupy storage on your device.
- If you need to free up space, you can manually delete photos from within the app, but doing so will permanently remove them from your collection.

A: No. All data is stored locally on your device. There is no cloud sync.

**Q: What if I delete the app?**  
A: All your saved data will be permanently deleted. We do not store any data on servers.
